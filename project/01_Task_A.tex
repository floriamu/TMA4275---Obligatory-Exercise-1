\section{Kaplan-Meier}
\textit{Use MINITAB to estimate and to draw in the same graph the KaplanMeier estimates $\hat{R}_1 (t)$ and $\hat{R}_2 (t)$.\\
Also let the MINITAB output contain the corresponding 95\% confidence curves.\\
Find and compare the estimated median, lower and upper quartiles of the two distributions.\\
What are the definitions and interpretations of these quantities?\\
How can they be read off from the curves?}
